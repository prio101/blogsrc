There is a few awesome frameworks which is almost like ruling the worlds of Web Development. If I start to count there is some heavy amount of PHP frameworks like CodeIgniter , Laravel , Phalcon , Yii , Zend , ASP .NET or Python Django and ofcourse many more .

{% if page.image %}
 <div class="post-img">
 <img class="img-responsive img-post" src=" {{site.baseurl}}/img/rubyrails.png "/>
 </div>
{% endif %}

But there is another one which has almost too loyal stream of follwer , and that is ["Ruby On Rals"]().
There can be question , "why ?" 
 
The answer would be , "Personally I tried php , and ASP .NET , but after trying RAILS , well , I can discover more with it".

So you are free to do some research and googling , And if you make your mind about Rails , You can start this 101 article. I am going to help you install Rails in your computer and get going.

### Step 1:

I am running Ubuntu and I have [RVM]() preinstalled. If you want to learn more about RVM then please read my previous article [Getting RVM](). You also can install ruby in your windows machine by installing [Rubyinstaller]()
and [PIK]() (which works almost same as RVM in Windows).

After getting ruby / rvm installed you can go to your Terminal or  hit ```ctrl``` + ```alt``` + ```T``` which will bring up your Terminal . Then in that type ,

	$ gem install rails 

This will have rails installed in your computer. Or if you would like to have a rails gem without documentaion , you can type
	
	$ gem install rails --without documentaion  # this will get rails without docs 



### Step 2:

Now if the installation is done you can go into your terminal and type:

	$ rails --version

Which will bring up the version that has been installed. Now you can go to your preffered location in your computer and create rails app. Or , do it like me,

	$ cd 	# This will take you to Home directory

	$ mkdir workspace_rails		# This will make a new directory in your home path

	$ cd workspace_rails		# changing current directory into newly made directory

	$ rails new app 		# This will make a new rails app named "app" 


### Step 3:

After full installtion of a rails app , you can change the path to your new app and get the first running app , by typing,

	$ cd app

	$ rails serve

This will bring up the new shiny app in a prebuilt and installed server , and you can see your app by going into your browser and typing [localhost:3000](#) in address bar. And by this time you should be having a screen like this,

<div class="post-img">
<img class="img-responsive img-post" src=" {{site.baseurl}}/img/rails-app.png "/>
</div>


So , you are now ready to go with your new rails app . This is a 101 , and any comment welcome. Until next time , take care.
