CSS Preprocessor is new Pie in world of Web Development. And in my last post I started about a beautiful preprocessor named SASS. And this is another part after last post.




{% if page.image %}
 <div class="post-img">
 <img class="img-responsive img-post" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/sass.jpg "/>
 </div>
{% endif %}

So , Lets get to the point.

There is some features in SASS like , **mixin** , with this mixin you can write down function like css snippet . Which can be used with argument or without it. Like,

	//Mixin

	@mixin color($color,$back-color){
		color:$color;
		background-color:$color;

	}


	//And to include it 

	.some-style{
		@include color(#fff,#777);
	} 	


Which will output,

	.some-style{
		color:#fff;
		background-color:#777;
	}


So , it is a charm isn't it? And here is another smashing stuff you will love. You can use and manipulate css flow with control-statements like 

* @if
* @while
* @each
* @for

Well , this can take your css works in to whole new level. Let me give a little example,

	
	p{
		  @if 1 + 1 == 2 { border: 1px solid;  }
		  @if 5 < 3      { border: 2px dotted; }
		  @if null       { border: 3px double; }
	  }
	
	
Output:

	p{
  	  border: 1px solid; 
  	 }

Just try to imagin how much power is on your hand if you start to manipulate the CSS sheet with Control statements. Whole power is up to you .

 Maybe next time I can talk about another CSS Preprossecor named LESS. Which is also fun to work with. Until then take care.
