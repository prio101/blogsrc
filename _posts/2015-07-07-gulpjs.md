## Dive into streams

There is task runner like [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) out there . But still , Gulp is awesome . In my opinion it uses streams of very specific module which is baked to do a very specific task. And to learn more about it , please read this article : [Grunt VS Gulp](http://jaysoo.ca/2014/01/27/gruntjs-vs-gulpjs/) .
**As you can see this is quite needed  to know what we are working with.**


So, today we will get geared with gulp by working with it . At the very beginning I would like to say,*You must have the Nodejs and Npm package manager installed in your Computer.*
Go into official [NODEJS](http://nodejs.org/) page and download it from there.

Let us consider a situation, that we are working with a [HTML5-Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) and We badly in need to compress the javascript codes so the performance of the server response get raised.

So, here is what we are going to do, in our terminal we are going to type destination of the current directory where we are working on. Like In my case its in <kbd>$ home/workstation/gulp-try/</kbd>. <br/><br/>
This is why in my terminal I wrote <kbd>cd /workstation/gulp-try/</kbd>. After that to install the gulp specific node module of uglify js which is named as "gulp-uglify" . We have to type, <kbd>npm install --save-dev gulp-uglify</kbd> in our Terminal. This will invoke the nodejs terms to get the module installed in our local directory.
