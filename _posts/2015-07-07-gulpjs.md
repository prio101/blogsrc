## Dive into streams

There is task runner like [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) out there . But still , Gulp is awesome . In my opinion it uses streams of very specific module which is baked to do a very specific task. And to learn more about it , please read this article : [Grunt VS Gulp](http://jaysoo.ca/2014/01/27/gruntjs-vs-gulpjs/) .
**As you can see this is quite needed  to know what we are working with.**


So, today we will get geared with gulp by working with it . At the very beginning I would like to say,*You must have the Nodejs and Npm package manager installed in your Computer.*
Go into official [NODEJS](http://nodejs.org/) page and download it from there.
